<p>
After cutting for nearly a year . I have reached a plateau .
So this winter I would be starting my offseason . 
A few pointers for beginners .

    <ol>
        <li><b>Measure</b> anything that you eat/drink.
        </li>
        <p>
            Bulking/Cutting is pure math. The idea is to have a calorie excess of
            500 cal which lets you gain around 1kg a week. Its easy to add a 1000 calories
            by just adding 2 tbsp of oil in every meal . Its possible to cut the same by halving the carb intake in each meal.
            Use the bisection method to find the sweet spot .

        </p>
        <li><b>Prioritize</b> weak points</li>
        <p>
            What you build in the offseason is what comes out after cutting .
            So even though your abs are not visible , keep training them hard .
            I am exceptionally lazy when it comes to ab training . So I train them
            first incorporating them into my warm up .
        </p>
        <li>Use workout <b>splits</b></li>
            <p>
                To build quality muscle , you would need to use all rep ranges from
                1-12 while exhausting major and supporting muscles. You cannot usually do this
                with full body workouts .The other added advantage, is that you could
                react to how you feel, changing rep range and tempo to cause complete fatigue.
            </p>
        <li><b>Perfection </b>can never be acheived</li>
        <p> If you are a part-time bodybuilder, you will never have 12 weeks
            where you can train 6 hours with a host of supplements and perfect sleep.
            Projects come, distractions happen , cheats happen .
            Its more important to get up than to avoid falling down .
            Do not try to follow a perfect diet for 3-4 weeks , learn how to get back
            on track after falling down.

        </p>
        <li>If you have time , add some <b>HIIT</b> cardio.</li>
        <p>
        I try to improve my surfing skills through cardio.
        <ul><li>
        Shoulder stamina :

        walk stairs carrying 20kg in each hand for 20 min.
        This improves paddling strength.
    </li><li>
        Balance board squats :
        Squatting and maintaining stability while squatting on balance board .
        Improves Pop up
    </li><li>
        Push ups on balance board :
        Again improves pop up .
    </li></ul>
        </p>
      <li>
          Meal <b>Preparation</b>
      </li>
        <p>
            Never be hungry and start thinking what to eat. Prep meals once/twice a
            week .Tupperware is your friend .I usually prepare my meals on sunday while
            measuring them each morning .Diet is playing with data, if your data
            is wrong so will your diet . So try to be accurate with your numbers .
            If your an endomorph, as I am you need your carb intake on your finger tips.
        </p>
        <li>
            Some <b>Power</b> training
        </li>
        <p>

            Its been some time since I trained for power. So started off this season with
            1 exercise 1-5 reps X 5 sets before going to hypertrophy .

        </p>

        <li>
            <b>AVOID TAKING SUPPORT</b>
            <P>

                I lost valuable years to this bad habit . You build a tendency to ego lift without
                recruiting all muscle fibres.
            </P>
        </li>


    </ol>

    Hope you found something to learn .
