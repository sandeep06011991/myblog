Someone I really like said she liked abs, so I decided to shred. 

Results:

![abs](/images/abs1.jpg){:class=" w-100-m w-third-ns pa1 br5"}

## Notes

    1. I have a tendency to undereat in the morning and overeat at night. This results in lethargic workouts 
    2. I rely on calorie deficit more than workout, this should change
    3. In this cycle, I injured both my legs, so lost substantial quad strength
