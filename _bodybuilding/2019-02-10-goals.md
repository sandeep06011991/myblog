Questions to answer.

### Why am I not following a competitive program?

A competive program would not take into account my personal skew.
Lower is substantially weaker than my upper body. Hence lower body should be hit
more frequently. There is a high chance I might miss workouts, in which case atleast
I can skip out low priority tasks and finish high priority ones. I have some key technical flaws
such as speed of drop in snatch that need special attention.
