            I am in love with systems and programming languages. I have paid my dues to leslie lamport, by breaking my
            head over the origin Paxos paper.
            I am looking for roles where I can implement cutting edge research papers to solve real problems.

            Apart from computer science, I am very serious about bodybuilding. I can squat 250 pounds and bench 225 pounds.
            For some wierd reason, I get better at my job because of gym( A synergy I do not want to disturb)
            I also love water sports (surfing, kayaking, scuba diving(Certified to max recreational depth)),
            skiing, running, cooking and playing guitar.
