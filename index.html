        My name is Sandeep Polisetty.
        I am a fifth year computer science MS/PhD student at the University
         of Massachusetts,  Amherst. 
         I am broadly interested in the systems for efficient machine learning with special interest in Graph Neural Networks, Quantization and Compiler optimizations for novel hardware. 
I look to attack every point of the stack for machine learning from novel hardware pipelines in verilog to efficient compilers  such as XLA and TVM. I am actively seeking research internship 
where I can work on related prolems.

         I am co-advised by Prof. Hui Guan and Prof. Marco Serafini. 

         My recent projects are:
         <ol>
<li> Ongoing project optimizing distributed training of GNN through locality centric execution</li>
            <li>Optimizing sampling on GPUs for Graph Neural Networks. (published: <a href = "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447786.3456244"> Eurosys 2021</a>)
 </li>
<li>  polyhedral optimization  for dynamic shape operators using TVM. (<a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=9atU6PIAAAAJ&citation_for_view=9atU6PIAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC" >Presented at TVMConf </a> work done during internship at reservoir labs summer 2021) </li>
         </ol>

            Apart from computer science, I love olympic weightlifting (especially snatch) and all outdoor rustic activities such as bushcraft, surfing, scuba diving. Apart from GPUs and communication scheduling, I can talk for hours on these other topics.
