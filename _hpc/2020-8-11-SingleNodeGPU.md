This blog in not about how to write cuda code, but to learn how to write better code.
I will discuss below the various performance metrics and give examples of coding decisions which impact them. A brief discription of relevant concepts will be provided where required.

1. Warp Occupancy.

2. Memory Transfer Cost.

3. Compute Cost

Task 1:
   Reduction and shared memory, constant memory

Task 2:
   Matrix Transpose.

Task 3:
   Matrix Multiplication.

*Credits. All experiments are performed on my advisor Prof. Marco server.
