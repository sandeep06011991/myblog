## Ingredients
**Essential**: chickenw, cornstarch, eggs, orange juice, sugar

**Optionals**: Orangezest, breadcrumbs

Serving size: 2

- 1 tablespoons cornstarch

- 2 egg whites

- 2 boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
Sauce:

- 1/2 cup orange juice (I used Simply Orange)

- 1 tablespoon soy sauce

- 1 packed tablespoon brown sugar

- 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar

- 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil

- Dash salt

- Dash crushed red pepper

- 1 clove garlic, pressed

- A little grated or minced ginger

- 1 teaspoon cornstarch

- Vegetable or peanut oil, for frying

## Instructions 



1. For the chicken: In a large bowl, whisk together the cornstarch 
and egg whites with a fork until almost frothy, about 1 minute. Add the chicken to the mixture
 and allow to sit for 5 to 10 minutes.

2. For the sauce: Meanwhile, put the orange juice, soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, sesame oil, 
salt, crushed red pepper, garlic and ginger in a small nonstick skillet and whisk. 
Heat until bubbling and starting to thicken, about 5 minutes. 

3. Whisk together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup water in a small bowl and add 1 to 2 tablespoons
 of the cornstarch slurry to the sauce. Mix in and thicken for 1 minute.

4. Heat about 2 inches of vegetable oil in a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven until a deep-fry 
thermometer inserted in the oil registers 350 degrees F. Carefully drop the
 chicken into the oil and move it around, flipping gently, until golden, 3 to 4 minutes.
  Let the pieces drain on a plate lined with paper towels for 2 to 3 minutes. 
  Then drop them back into the oil for 1 minute to really solidify the coating. **Double frying**

Toss the chicken in the sauce and serve.

## Notes 

1. No onion or other extras. Dont add unnecessarily
