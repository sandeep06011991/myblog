        The high temperature required for stir-frying sears food 
        quickly and preserves the natural juices. It takes only 
        minutes (two to five, usually), so vegetables stay bright 
        and crisp, meat browned and succulent. When the heat is high
        and the cooking quick, the Cantonese describe the result as
        wok hayâ€•loosely translated "the breath of a wok." It's a
        difficult quality to define, but you can experience it in the
        first few moments after food is removed from the wok. The food
        tastes vibrant and fresh, characterized by concentrated, harmonious
        flavors with a hint of smokiness. To appreciate wok hay, serve 
        food immediately.

    ** VERY INCOMPLETE **
1. Blanche veggies, pan not hot enough, meat should be dry and do not season before cooking
It should be crunchy and not soggy. 


    COMEBACK AND FINISH 
5. Add soy sauce and stir fry **AFTER** adding the rice. Do not burn the **SAUCE**.
    Unrelated note, since soy sauce could reduce due to heat. Add 1:1 ratio
