## Ingredients

1 lb spaghetti uncooked
2 tbsp olive oil
1 lb ground beef extra lean
1 large onion chopped
4 cloves garlic minced
1 tbsp oregano dried
1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
2 tbsp tomato paste
1 cup red wine
28 oz crushed tomatoes (1 can)
2 tbsp basil chopped
1/2 tsp salt or to taste
1/2 tsp pepper or to taste
1/4 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup Parmesan cheese grated
2 tbsp basil chopped, for garnish

## Instructions

1. Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions. Keep the pasta water, in case needed for sauce.

2. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook for 3 minutes, breaking it as you go, until no longer pink.

3. Add the onion and garlic and cook for another 3 minutes until the onion softens.

4. Add the oregano, red pepper flakes, tomato paste and stir. Stir in the red wine and cook for about 5 minutes until most of the liquid has cooked off.

5. Add the crushed tomatoes, basil and season with salt and pepper. Stir and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a medium-low. Cover the pot and cook for about 20 minutes.

5. Stir in the heavy cream and adjust for seasoning if needed. If your sauce is too thick add some of the pasta water to thin it out.

5. Add the spaghetti to the pot and toss well with the sauce. Top with Parmesan cheese and basil. Serve immediately.
