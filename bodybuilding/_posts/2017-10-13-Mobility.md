Over the last 6 months I got my squats without wraps from 70Kg to 100Kg.
At 100 Kg I have injured my back 2-3 time over the last 2 months.

I lack
    1. Knee stabilizers
    2. Tight Hips
    3. Overall low mobility
    4. No serious pre workout stretch or post workout stretch

I am going off powerlifting till I can improve this mobility.
I will focus on mobility + hypertrophy as accessory.

Hold each stretch for at least 15 seconds and repeat each stretch if you have time.

Post Workout stretch
static stretching
