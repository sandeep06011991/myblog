A girl ignored me. Time to unravel what I have built over this year.
I am quite strong now by indian standards but still a novice.
I will try to maintain as much muscle as possible

Target to go under  80kg again.
Long term target....  Get completely ripped.
If I have to bulk add microcycles for 4-5 weeks and go back.
