    <!-- 2018 was a special year for me.
    I got a masters degree, made amazing friends, got an internship at AWS and achieved all my bodybuilding goals.
    In technology my performance was amazing with back to back offers, as was my body goals.
    However, I also realized that there was more to computer science than software engineering as I have perfected during my MS.
    There was a depth that I aspired for that I lacked.
    There is more to computer science than blindly building systems, I hoped research would lead me the way.
    Parallely with pure bodybuilding I reached a point where steroid was the only way forward.
    Similarly, I found olympic lifting and strength which would give the muscle recruitment for more hypertropy and leaner physique.
    I felt 2 skills missing in what I was.
    The guy who squats 100kg for 10 reps builds more muscle than the guy who squats 60 kg for reps.
    Similarly, someone who has built heterogenous computing/machine learning pipelines is more useful then someone who has moved data around apis.
    Thus I started my PhD and also olympic weightlifting. -->


    <!-- Things seemed to go well, untill one day everything fell on May 11, 2019.
    I lost all hope, I became fat.
    I couldnt focus on research, so binge watched tv shows boston legal, outdoor man etc..
    In 2019, I tried my best to get research output and learn olympic lifting.
    However, I messed up as I did not execute the research properly.
    I built something without  having any idea about the research problem and therefore no story to tell.
    <!-- This was my bitmatrix paper, which is the worst research done by man. -->
    <!-- Thats when I realize how easy it is to get stuck when you implement without a hypothesis.
    I would have left this hadnt been that my advisor stuck me on this for months.
    Since I never believed in this, I could never get the momentum I believed.
    Finally in 2020 summer, I reached an all low point.
    My research was distracted, physique lost and I could barely get a decent internship.
    Asked all my friends if I should quit, visited my uncles and that changed my life.
    My uncles are fighters who suffered more than I ever did and won. -->
    <!-- Its time to fight back, and then I remembered "Its not who is going to let me, its who is going to stop me". -->
    This page posts everything I learnt from weightlifting, how it has influenced me.

    Goals: There are lots of interesting things even in weightlifting such as clean/jerks, bench, squat. 
    However, as we know we focus on only one or two things at a time. The primary focus is always the most challenging
    movement. For me, it is the oly lifts where I spend most of my time. Similarly in computer science, my current research in 
    sysml is the oly lifts, and database/other pure systems is strength work. I like both, but at this moment, I suck more in sysml
    and it has a direct impact on my goals. Hence I decided to ignore or treat other interests in computer science as accessories.
    Something I do once a week, or at the very end of my day. 
    Lesson: Indentify your primary and secondary goals and treat them accordingly.

    Technique: The final paper we get is a product of both research technique and innovation. I like to think of this
    similar to technique in weightlifting and innovation as weight. Some people manage to get big numbers
    with crappy technique, but the sure fire way for average people to improve is to focus on technique. 
    Focus on it everyday every session, perfect everyphase of the lift with lower weights gradually increasing it. 
    Finally when we master technique in the 70-90% the 100% will automatically improve. 
    Lesson: Do not focus on the outcome of my research, try to perfect technique at every session. 
    Every table I generate should be precise, every claim validated.
