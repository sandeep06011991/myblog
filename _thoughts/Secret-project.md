Research is about freedom of thought, expression, to show untamed love or unmatched hatred.
Logic with honesty
Freedom from this suffocation. I do what I love, I fight as hard as I can.
I am plain with no mask. But then they hit you from behind and never straight.
I miss life in startups, where you spent nights on your couch.
Nothing else mattered and you trusted your peer.
Is this life right for me ?
May be you cant have friends you have to professional.
Should I be ok working where I have no friends.
Where we cant joke around.
Be bold.
I am lifter who trains alone in the hills.
The bar is my god and the weight my judgement.
I miss the gym, I see eyes wanting me to win.
Out here i see eyes that dont care.
What I wanted was a teacher and a partner.
so much conformity makes me ask is this a zumba class.
There is no brotherhood but everyman for himself.
Trust me you will never have colloboration,
You managed to create a breed of men who dont care.
With no love for each other just for themselves.
I wonder how far we will get along like this.
With our relations defined in ink
