Everyday remember we are training for this goal.

2. Be up and working early @ 7. Related cause is wasting time on youtube.

  Why do I take forever to get up.
  Because I sleep late @ 2, given how tired from gym. I am not so suprised I wake up late.

  How can I change this, be in bed by 10 and start reading fiction book.
  What prevents this, wasting time, especially on random youtube crap.
  What kind of crap. meal prep, day of eating, indian politics, crossfit programming.
  Sometimes re-watching movies.

  a. Cue: Stress, a lot of things to do dont know where to start. Sometimes, body is too tired and I want to rest.
      When I am cooking. Once I get started, it goes on forever.
      At the start of day, make a list of small tasks which I can unconsciously start and are exciting.

## Goal for the GNN project.

1. This snapshot should be itself worthy of a workshop paper at the least.
1. I will circulate this workshop paper to prof. Arun and ask his feedback.
2. Finish first round of experiements on a single layer for GNN and compare with another strategy such as neugraph.
3. Formalize the theory behind this experiment, expectation.

### Key Research questions.

1. What is the data partitioning strategy followed by Neugraph. Given a graph, describe an example how neugraph partitions the graph.  
2. What is search space exploration strategy of flexflow. Given a DNN example, describe how flexflow explores, declares the model space.
3. Test gypsum for multi-gpu setting. Try large matrix multiplication.
4. Formalize the math of Reducing communication, How this is done.


## NLP project

1. Finish experimentation and write up of my contributions for course project.
  a. Read the proposal and understand what I am supposed to do. (2 hours)
  b. Start NLP project.

## Chores.

1. Share TA code with andrew.
2. Add sudo user to juelin.
3. Guide alexander a bit.

    a. Get current snapshot of ALTOP and ALTOP_Latex.
    b. Main competitors are: EmptyHeaded, GRO. What is left over here.  
    c. Understad an example of emptyheaded, query generation strategy for the barbell query.
    d. Prove that for quasi-clique emptyheaded will generate large joins.
    d. Given a graph, how would gro, reorder the graph.
    e. Why is GRO not a complete solution. My solution could be denser than gro. Why because I operate on a smaller subset.

## Three movies I want to watch this month..

Every week I want to watch a movie, but I end up failing miserably.
Audible book for me.
