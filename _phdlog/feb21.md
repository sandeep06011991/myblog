Daily ToDos

 What is stopping me from hitting those goals. (The What IFs)
 1. Procrastination is a habit avoid it like plague.
    Do not wait till you feel like it.
    Force yourself to do a small bit, the momentum will make it easy.
    Visualize yourself doing the small bit.

 2. Track your daily macros. Get enough sleep. Wake up early. Be effecient with training time.

 3. Track your daily tasks and forest hours.

 4. Sunday is my chill day. Have alchohol at 2'ish and binge watch movies or tv shows. Other days its banned.
