I finally got rid of my past project. I finished write up of my work,
and posted in to marco. I finally learnt an important lesson.
Advisor is not a coach. I have to follow my own instincts.

I got started on a project with hui. Finished some background reading for it.
Finished GPU book and did some experiments.
Ideally looking to publish something in the next few months

Week3#
Good:
Tracked calories, put in good work cycle.
Played around with gpus and read some papers on this gpu and data processing.
Measured things on elba. Went to a dentist.

Bad:
Unexpected crash mentally exhausted on saturday. Ended up drinking
and ate a lot.
For next week, I need to do a better job at tracking my sleep and wake up time.
