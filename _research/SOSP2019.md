An overview of systems concepts relevant to me. For each concept pick some papers and some experiment.

Current SOSP 2019.

Types of Memory:
  Goal: How does application design change with constraints.
  NUMA:
    Scalable and practical locking with shuffling
    Gemini:
  NVMe:
    KVell: the design and implementation of a fast persistent key-value store
  Persistance:
    Recipe: converting concurrent DRAM indexes to persistent-memory indexes

Consistency:
  Aegean: replication beyond the client-server model
  Lineage Stash: Fault Tolerance Off the Critical Path

Compiler:
  Optimizing Data-Intensive Computations in Existing Libraries with Split Annotations

GPU:
  Nexus: a GPU cluster engine for accelerating DNN-based video analysis

Graph-Specific:
  KnightKing:
    Random Walks in graphs.

ML application:
  Parity models: erasure-coded resilience for prediction serving systems
  PipeDream: generalized pipeline parallelism for DNN training
  A generic communication scheduler for distributed DNN training acceleration
  TASO: optimizing deep learning computation with automatic generation of graph substitutions
